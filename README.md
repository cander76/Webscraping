# Webscraping

For this project, I chose to form a dataset for the Top 64 movies of all time according to Rotten Tomatoes. I hope to take this dataset to perform an exploratory data analysis later on. 

# Libraries I used

While doing this project, I used the following libraries:

-Pandas
-BeautifulSoup
-request

# Where I got the data

The data was retreived from a webpage on IMDB with the title "Rotten Tomatoes" Top 100 Movies. The link to this website can be found [here](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls033935095/). For the top 64 movies on the list, I extracted the title, year, rating, genre, and runtime.

# In this repository

In this repository you will find the ipynb file in which I did all of my code to form the data frame. There is also a csv file with the final data frame attached.
